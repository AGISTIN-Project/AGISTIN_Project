Models for AGISTIN D3.2 Open-source Simulation models

Files: 
alkaline_stack_design.m is to find the configuration to fulfill the requirements: 
- 1.5 MW nominal power
- 700-1200 Vdc for direct coupling

alkaline_stack_IV_and_performance.m also runs alkaline_stack_design.m 
- plots IV-curve

- generic_AEL.slx is the actual model and runs stand alone (with alkaline_ely_mask.m)
